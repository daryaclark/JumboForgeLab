# Project 0: Applying Machine Learning Principles to ROS2
## Learning Objectives
- Practice writing ROS2 python scripts to control motors and sensors on the iRobot Create3
- Attach hardware to the Raspberry Pi and access data that can be used to determine the robot's actions
- Learn techniques in Machine Learning and use in code 

## Project Outline
Students will use the iRobot Create3 with a Picamera2 and an ultrasonic sensor to navigate an obstacle course. Students will program robots to drive forward. If an object is within 6 inches of its path, students will take a photo using the Picamera2. Before running, students will use Google's teachable machine to create a trained data set on what 8 objects are. Thus, when they take a photo, the object will be identified accordingly. Prior to starting the final run through, students will be provided the course 10 minutes before, thus knowing whether to turn left or right after approaching the object
