# Project Example 1: Line Following Robot - Introduction to PID Controllers

## Learning Objectives
- Students will integrate a color sensor into the robot's design and learn how to calibrate and utilize the sensor to detect color variations on the track.
- Students will understand the principles of Proportional, Integral, and Derivative (PID) control and implement PID algorithms to accurately control the robot's movement along the line.
- Students will design, build, and assemble the physical structure of the robot and learn about the different components of a robot, including motors, sensors, and controllers, and how they work together to achieve specific tasks.
